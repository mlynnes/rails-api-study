# Rails as an API Study

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

Please note:

-   Many of the readings will mention the "view" layer. We won't be covering the
    view layer in this program.
-   We'll use our [Rails API Template](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/rails-api-template)
    repository as the basis for our rails applications.
    This template excludes the "view" layer.

## Define Model Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the model layer are in
Rails.

```md
Models are ruby classes that communicate with the database. They confirm and store data. As said in the reading, models do the "heavy lifting."
```

## Define Controller Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the responsibilities of the controller layer are
in Rails.

```md
Controllers parse through user requests, sessions, cookies, and data submissions. They then communicate with the model, telling it to do something. Upon success, it returns the metadata and response body to the server.
```

## Define Router Responsibilities

In your own words, define what the router does in Rails.

```md
Points us to the appriopriate controller.
```

## The Request-Response Cycle in Rails

Starting with a client making a GET request to a particular URL, describe how
the parts of Rails interact to produce and send a response.

```md
1. Browser makes GET request
2. Server recieves request
3. Server uses a router to point to the appropriate controller
4. Server uses dispatcher to create new controller and it then asks a model to get the website
5. Model communicates with database and gets the website
6. Model passes info back to the controller
7. Controller then sends the response body and metadata back to the web server and relays that message to the client
```
